# FocusLearn
🔥 FocusLearn – Master Learning with Structured Focus
FocusLearn is an intelligent, modular productivity platform designed to help learners and knowledge seekers stay organized, focused, and consistent while reading books (PDFs) or watching online tutorials (YouTube).

Imagine Notion meets YouTube meets Kindle — now supercharged with progress tracking, timeline notes, productivity analytics, and white-noise immersion, all in one unified platform.

📌 Why FocusLearn?
In today’s fast-paced learning culture, resources are scattered:
📘 PDFs stored in folders,
📺 YouTube links saved in bookmarks,
📝 Notes in some other app,
⏱️ Progress manually tracked (or not at all),
🎧 Focus music played separately.

This fragmentation breaks your momentum.

FocusLearn fixes this. It brings everything under one roof.
